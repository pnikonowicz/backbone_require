This site uses Backbone.js just for fun, Require.js to load up
libraries, Mustache.js for templating, colorbox for the lightbox part,
and jasmine for testing.

Because I wanted to show off the routing capabilities of backbone,
when you click a 'more' link, a routing request is fired. This isn't
an optimal solution however. I only did it to show off the routing
capabilities.

I did not want to have a server or any external compilation steps.
Therefore sass was not used. Also, because there is no server, I could
not get templates using Require.js. There is more information about
this in index.html. It is also why you will see a 'get' error when the
page starts. Ordinarily this would not happen.

I was originally going to add media queries to support mobile and full
screen devices, but it's getting late and I think what I have here
should at least give you what you need.

To see the site, simply point your browser to index.html.
